CLick on this link: https://ivparameters.streamlit.app/  to access the web app.
## This web-app is created by Rakesh Suthar, Graduate student, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (IIT-Delhi), New Delhi, India.

This simple web app calculator extracts the photovoltaics parameters from the raw current-voltage data. And will be helpful in the photovoltaics community.

This web app is now the part of nanohub.org Tools, and can be cite as
